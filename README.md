<p>It is not possible to host a Django site on Github pages. Github pages is for static sites, whereas Django requires Python to generate pages dynamically.</p>
<p>So my static website-CV is located at https://nickitque.github.io/, Django app - at "landing" folder.</p>
<h3>If you want to see how my Django app is builded:</h3>
<p>1. Download repo and unpack it locally.</p>
<p>2. Open terminal in the directory where project is unpacked.</p>
<p>3. Enter command "python manage.py runserver".</p>
<p>4. Follow the way in terminal (it should be http://127.0.0.1:8000/).</p>
<p>5. To Quit the server use combination CTRL+C.</p>
