<p>It is not possible to host a Django site on Github pages. Github pages is for static sites, whereas Django requires Python to generate pages dynamically.</p>
<p>So my static website-CV is located at https://nickitque.github.io/, Django app - at this repository at "landing" folder.</p>
<p><em>Sorry for poor design and markup of static website. It was made just for representing HTML and CSS skills.
The Django project also only for representing the understanding of migrations, url.py, models.py, views.py and etc principle of work.</em> </p>
<h3>If you want to see how my Django app is builded:</h3>
<p>1. Download repo and unpack it locally.</p>
<p>2. Open terminal in the directory where project is unpacked.</p>
<p>3. Enter command "python manage.py runserver".</p>
<p>4. Follow the way in terminal (it should be http://127.0.0.1:8000/).</p>
<p>5. To Quit the server use combination CTRL+C.</p>
